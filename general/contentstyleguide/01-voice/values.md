Our values are the core Moodle beliefs and unify everything we do. Our personality is influenced by our values and describes the set of characteristics that we attribute to Moodle. Or, to put it another way, it's how we describe Moodle as if Moodle were a person. Understanding our brand personality is essential because it helps us connect more deeply to our brand identity and fosters brand loyalty.  

Finally, our principles are a set of guiding behaviors that inform everything we do, irrespective of who we're talking to, shifting goals, strategies, activities, or the competitive market.
